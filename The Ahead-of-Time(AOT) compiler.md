# The Ahead-of-Time(AOT) compiler

Angular compilation

1. Just-in-Time(JIT), which copiles your app in the browser at runtime
2. Ahead-of-Time(AOT), which compiles your app at build time

***



Why compile with AOT?

* Faster rendering
* Fewer asynchronous requests
* Smaller Angular framework download size
* Detect template errors earlier
* Better security
