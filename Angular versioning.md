# Angular versioning

Angular use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Angular version numbers have three parts: **major.minor.patch** 

For example, version 5.2.9 indicates major version 5, minor version  2 ant patch version 9

* Major releases contain significant new features, some but mininal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, your may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.
* Minor releases contain new smaller features. Minor release are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistances is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release.
* Patch releases are low risk, bug fix release.



Pre-release previews-such as Beta and **Release Candidate** versions-are indicated by appending a dash and a beta or rc identifier, such as version 5.2.9-rc.3
